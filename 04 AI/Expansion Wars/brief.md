# Expansion Wars — Brief (AI notes)

## Current state

- MVP built as a plain HTML/CSS/JS page in `03 Projects/Expansion Wars/`. No build step, no server, no database.
- Map: Voronoi regions. Each spot is a seed point; its region is the cell around it. Land regions that share an edge are linked by a road. Lakes are regions with no roads. Nine levels (`js/map.js` LEVELS): Levels 1–4 fit one screen with 4 to 10 spots. Levels 5–9 are 1.5 screens wide, with 12 to 20 spots, fortresses (🏯), and pan by dragging on empty ground. Teams on Levels 4, 6 and 8. Each map is checked for land connectivity before use.
- City tiers (`js/game.js` CITY_LEVELS): village 20, town 40, city 60, metropolis 80 caps; upgrade costs 20, 30, 40 soldiers.
- Every generated map is saved as a record (level, title, description, features, rating 1–5, plays, wins, losses, improvement notes, map geometry). Notes are logged from ⚙️ during play; saved maps are listed from ⚙️ → Saved maps.
- Storage: maps and notes are kept on this device first (`js/store.js`), then written to the Family table `xw_maps` by `js/cloud.js` once the family account signs in (⚙️ → Family database). Pulls newer copies from other devices. Progress and high scores stay on this device. Notes are rows inside `xw_maps.notes` as `{id, at, text, status}`; status is `open` or `done` (set with 'Mark done' in Saved maps). To read feedback: `select title, n->>'text', n->>'status' from public.xw_maps, jsonb_array_elements(notes) n;`. Live read verified 2026-11-03 via Supabase: 18 open notes across 13 map records, mostly Level 4 Valley duplicates. Round 3 items are built in code, but their notes are still `open` until Jimmy confirms (see `todo.md` Round 4).
- Rules: owned spots produce soldiers; sending half from a spot along a road; fights resolve on arrival; win by owning every spot.
- Computer players: Easy and Normal, both "send half of the strongest spot to the weakest linked neighbor" on a timer.

## Architecture

- `js/map.js` builds Voronoi maps and exposes `window.ExpansionMap` (levels, generation, distance).
- `js/store.js` exposes `window.XWStore` (saved maps: add, update, game result, note, rating).
- `js/game.js` holds the state, the frame loop (`step` then `render`), input (pointer events on the board), computer players and the win check.
- `js/sound.js` synthesizes tones with Web Audio. No sound files.
- Board uses a 1000 × 640 map coordinate space. Nodes are HTML divs, roads and soldier markers are SVG on the same coordinates, so the board scales with the screen.

## Verified vs. unverified

- Verified (headless Chromium, 1024 × 768): page loads with no errors; map has 30 spots and 8 lakes; 2- and 4-player starts appear; a drag to a linked spot launches soldiers and captures it; the 4-player game runs with no page errors.
- Round 4 (2026-11-03), headless Chromium 1024 × 768: levels 1–9 each start with the right spot, city, fortress and team counts; pan moves the field on levels 5–9; a drag from an own spot launches soldiers on levels 5 and 8; no page errors (the only console errors are the Supabase CDN script blocked by the sandbox).
- Unverified: device feel on iPad (touch dragging, panning, sizes), balance of rates and garrisons, computer difficulty on the new levels.

## Next steps

0. Round 11: the country view draws each province as an icon in its nation's region (🍄 village, 🏘️ town, 🏰 city, 🏯 fortress), with zoom buttons, wheel zoom, Fit, and drag to pan. The province battle link is still not built.
0b. Round 10 (`convo/convo v0.9.md`): version 2 first playable slice built in `js/country.js` (🌍 on the home screen). Six nations, turns of 60 s with Ready, diplomacy on the nation card, growing, power and stage, country battles resolved at once. Not built: province battles, veteran upgrades, magic and culture effects, game log, tutorial levels 16 to 20. Version 1 is untouched in `V1/`.
0a. Round 8 (`convo/convo v0.7.md`): version 1 archived in `V1/` and linked from ⚙️ ("Play version 1 (archive)"). Version 2 design answers recorded (convo v0.7 and v0.8).
1. Round 7 (`convo/convo v0.6.md`, notes read 2026-11-04): built with defaults to check: team members keep their player colours (Level 4 note), and spots keep the same size on screen at any zoom (Level 5 note). Open: the test note. Still open from v0.5: surrender defaults, mid-upgrade capture, fortress numbers.
2. Round 6 (`convo/convo v0.5.md`): built with defaults to check: surrender (10 to 1, off by default), upgrade times (3, 6, 10 s) with dust, levels 10 to 15 (multiplayer, denser, two screens wide), zoom buttons, pinch and minimap. Still open: surrender default and neutral spots, spot size when zoomed out (spots shrink to a 44 px minimum, so they overlap on dense maps), capture mid-upgrade, fortress numbers, and the test note.
2. Build the round 5 items once answered. The Level 5 notes are the first real play on the new maps.
3. Play a few games on iPad, including Levels 5 to 9 with panning. Balance pass stays on the todo.

## Working rules (from Jimmy's notes)

- Tick todo items in the same change that builds them. Mark notes done only after Jimmy confirms (skill rule).
- Each round starts a new branch from `main`. The round 4 PR was merged.
